## What does this mod do?
This mod changes every nation's name to that in their original culture's language, during the 1444 start date or earlier.

Example: "Spain" becomes "Espa√±a".

## Current Features:

* A fully localised Europe, with all formables and releasables being renamed.
* A fully localised Asia, with all formables and releasables being renamed.
* Ironman compatible

## Known Issues:

* Nations who's name are not originally in Latin have been romanized.
* A few nations still haven't been translated correctly.
* Not all names are correct, mistakes may be addressed in the sticky below.
* EU4 doesn't accept alot of UTF-8 characters, not even something as simple as the Nordic alphabet, so a lot of nations their names have been dumbed down.
