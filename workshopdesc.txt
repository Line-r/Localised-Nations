[h1]What does this mod do?[/h1]
This mod changes every nation's name to that in their culture's language, during the 1444 start date.
Example: "Spain" becomes "Espa√±a".

[h1]Current Features:[/h1]
[list]
[*]A fully localised Europe, with all formables and releasables being renamed.
[*]Ironman compatible
[/list]

[h1]Known Issues:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Nations who's name are not originally in Latin have been romanized.
[*]A few nations still haven't been translated correctly.
[*]Not all names are correct, especially the Old Slavic speaking nations.
[*]EU4 doesn't accept alot of UTF-8 characters, not even something as simple as the Nordic alphabet, so a lot of nations their names have been dumbed down.
[/list]


[h1]I want to contribute[/h1]
The research into old and forgotten languages for this mod was quite hard, and not everything is accurate.
Most of the translations were taken from Wikipedia and other sources.

If you'd happen to know any translations for nations their names, both in Europe and outside, feel free to contribute by adding to the discussion posts.
In case you notice any bugs or other issues, please let me know, and I'll address them.

For anyone who's interested, we have a GitHub repo, which you can use to get notified whenever the mod updates: https://github.com/Line-r/Localised-Nations
